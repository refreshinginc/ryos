# âœ¨ RYOS Official SDK âœ¨

The Official RYOS Authentication SDK.

## ðŸŸ¥ Installation 

```
npm install --save ryos
```

## ðŸŸ§ API

```js
const ryos = require("ryos")
```

### Auth

`ryos.auth(domain, scopes, redirect)` [Example](#authenticating-a-user) | [Scopes](#-available-scopes)

Initiates the authentication process and redirects the user to the official RYOS authentication domain (`ryos.org`).

- `domain` (String) [Required]: The base domain requesting authorization.
- `scopes` (Array) [Required]: An array of strings representing the requested scopes (e.g., `["profile", "email"]`).
- `redirect` (String) [Required]: The URL to redirect back to after successful authentication.

- Returns (void): This method initiates the authentication process and redirects the user to the RYOS authentication domain. No value is returned as the process is handled via the redirect.

### Check
`ryos.check()` [Example](#check-for-ryos-one-time-code)

Checks the current URL for the `ryos` query parameter, extracts the code, and returns it if found.

- Returns (String | null): Returns the RYOS code if found, otherwise `null`.

### Validate

`ryos.validate()` [Example](#validating-one-time-codes)

Checks if the current URL contains the `ryos` query, grabs the auth code, validates code, resolves code to a session token and stores to a secure cookie.

- Returns (Boolean): `true` if the code was found, validated, resolved to session token and stored to secure cookie, `false` otherwise.

### Logout

`ryos.logout()` [Example](#logging-out)

Logs the user out by removing the authentication token stored in the cookie.

- Returns (Boolean): `true` if logout was successful, `false` if logout failed.

## ðŸŸ¨ Usage

### Authenticating A User
To start the authentication process and redirect the user to Ryos' login page with the specified URL and scope:
```js
// Import the RYOS SDK
const ryos = require("ryos");

// Redirects the user and requests example.com get access to the users identity before redirecting to https://example.com/authorized
ryos.auth("example.com", ["identity"], "https://example.com/authorized");
```

### Check for RYOS One-Time Code
Checks the current URL for the `ryos` query parameter, extracts the code, and returns it if found:
```js
// Import the RYOS SDK
const ryos = require("ryos");

// Check for the RYOS auth code in the URL
const foundCode = ryos.check();

if (foundCode) {
console.log("RYOS code found in current URL");
}
```

### Validating One-Time Codes
After a user logs in and has been redirected back to your specified redirect url, you can call ryos.validate() to check for a ryos code in the url query, and validate it:
```js
// Import the RYOS SDK
const ryos = require("ryos");

// Check the current URL for a RYOS auth code
const foundCode = ryos.check();

// If no code is found, log and exit early
if (!foundCode) {
    console.log("Auth code not found in URL.");
    return;
}

// Validate the found auth code and check the result
ryos.validate(foundCode).then(isValidated => {
    if (isValidated) {
        console.log("Session token saved to cookie.");
    } else {
        console.log("Auth code is invalid or expired.");
    }
}).catch(error => {
    console.error("Error during validation:", error);
});
```

### Logging Out
To log out the user and remove the stored token:
```js
// Import the RYOS SDK
const ryos = require("ryos");

// Log the user out by removing the authentication token from the cookie
ryos.logout();

// Confirm that the user has logged out
console.log("You have logged out.");
```

## ðŸŸ© Available Scopes

The scope parameter in the `ryos.auth(domain, scopes, redirect)` method allows you to specify what kind of access youâ€™re requesting from the authenticated user. Below are the common scopes you can request:

- `identity`: Access to the user's username.
